## Supabase Implementation: Status Update & Next Steps

**Date**: August 18, 2025

**Project**: Jorhat Tennis Club Tournament App

This document outlines the current progress of the Supabase backend implementation and defines the immediate next steps required to move into the application development phase, as per the project roadmap.

### Progress Summary: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ

We have successfully completed the entire database foundation (Phase 1 of the roadmap). The backend is now secure, scalable, and ready for the application layer.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Database Schema Finalized (20250815212826_create_initial_schema.sql)**
   - All tables (spaces, space_members, players, tournaments, etc.) have been created according to the multi-tenant design.
   - Data integrity is enforced through FOREIGN KEY relationships with ON DELETE CASCADE and CHECK constraints.

2. **Performance Indexes Implemented (20250816225729_add_indexes.sql)**
   - All necessary indexes, including composite primary keys on junction tables (space_members, entry_players), have been added.
   - This ensures that database queries, particularly for security checks, will be highly performant and scalable.

3. **Robust Security Policies Deployed (20250816231720_enable_rls_and_add_policies.sql)**
   - Row-Level Security (RLS) has been enabled on all user-data tables.
   - A comprehensive set of security policies has been written and implemented.
   - Crucially, these policies correctly differentiate between roles:
     - **Read Access**: Granted to any authenticated user who is a member of a space.
     - **Write Access (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)**: Strictly limited to members with the 'admin' role.

### Next Steps: Phase 2 - Authentication & Route Protection üîê

With the database complete, the immediate priority is to build the user-facing authentication system and secure the admin sections of the Next.js application.

#### Action Items

1. **Implement Authentication UI**
   - Task: Build the login and signup forms within the (auth)/login and (auth)/signup routes.
   - Tool: Use the @supabase/supabase-js client library.
   - Functions: Implement supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() and supabase.auth.signUp().

2. **Protect Admin Routes (Server-Side)**
   - Task: Prevent unauthenticated users from accessing any part of the admin dashboard.
   - Location: Implement this logic in the server-side layout file: app/(with-sidebar)/layout.jsx.
   - Logic: Use a server-side Supabase client to check for an active user session. If no session exists, redirect the user to the login page.

3. **Scope All Application-Level Queries**
   - Task: Ensure every database query made from the application code is explicitly filtered by the space ID.
   - Implementation: For the MVP, use the hardcoded environment variable process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SPACE_ID in all Supabase queries (e.g., .eq('space_id', ...)). This complements the RLS policies by ensuring the app only ever requests data for the correct space.
