## Progress Log â€” 2025-08-19

### Summary
- Removed all localStorage usage (wizard drafts, tournaments). Drafts and launches are fully Supabase-backed.
- Refactored to `domain/` and `data/` folders; removed `lib/`.
- Manual knockout flow: generate Semis/Final via buttons; persist semis/final scores; disabled Final generation until semis completed.
- Dashboard shows active tournament from DB; Past Events lists completed tournaments.

### Key Changes
- Wizard:
  - Draft autosave/hydrate via `wizard_drafts` only.
  - Launch uses server action to insert `tournaments`, `entries`, `matches`.
  - Header shows current step; launch button validation added.
- Manage:
  - Manual buttons for Semis/Final; DB-backed persistence for bracket scores.
  - Complete Tournament button (admin-only) updates status to `completed` and redirects to Past Events.
- Live:
  - Fixed client component errors; reads entries/matches from Supabase.
- Cleanup:
  - Deleted `data/localStore.js`, `data/wizardDraft.js`. Updated README and docs to reflect Supabase-only flow.
